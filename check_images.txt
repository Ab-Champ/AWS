Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: NO, only vgg model did classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as Dog_02.jpg
alexnet model classify Dog_02 as malinois
resnet model classify Dog_02 as dingo, warrigal, warragal, canis dingo 
All the three models did classify Dog_01 as german shephard 


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer:  Yes


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Vgg model did the best at classifying as it correctly identified the dog breeds of Dog_01 and Dog_02. Also it classified correct matches for dog and not dog. It had a score of pct_match: 75.0,
pct_correct_dogs: 100.0,
pct_correct_breed: 100.0,
pct_correct_notdogs: 100.0
These scores are much higher than other model architectures and provide good accuracy for classification.
